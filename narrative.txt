You nod your head and give him a weak smile. He reaches over and, plucking your glass from the table, says “You’re still looking a little green around the gills, it’s quite common for those who haven’t ridden on a subrail before. It might help to lay down for a bit while your body adjusts to the depth.” He sets down your now full glass in front of you and with a smile departs, exiting through the West door labeled "Staff Only".

EXAMINE [room] &init& {
The dining car is well lit with warm electric lighting that reflects off the polished wood tables and chairs. To one side is a couple of armchairs and a settee with a low table where one might chat or play a hand of cards. Further down lies the bar; closed at this late hour. The rest of the room is filled with dining tables, only two of which are occupied; one by an older #man# and another by a young #woman#. To the #East# is a door leading to the passenger sleeping quarters.

The poster announces in large black letters, “Welcome Aboard the Transatlantic Suboceanic Rail! The safest way to cross the depths of the ocean.”

EXAMINE [man] &init& {
The older man sits hunched over his table, engrossed in his writing. Looking closer, you can see that his once respectable suit now shows signs of considerable wear with patches haphazardly sewn on and stains decorating the surface. As he writes, he mutters under his breath and, although he pauses to drink his coffee, his eyes never stray from the pages in front of him.

Approaching the man, you begin to speak but he stops you waving his hands and saying, “No, no, no, I can’t be bothered right now, I’ve almost solved it.”

The young woman sits alone at a table, an untouched cup of tea next to her. She’s wearing a pale blue dress of fine quality and you can see that she has soft hands, the kind that have never seen a hard day of labour. She stares vacantly at the room, her mind seemingly far away.

TALK [woman] &init& {
You approach the young woman and greet her. She turns to you but her expression remains distant. 

“Can you feel it? Something is coming, something...dark.”

Shifting her gaze back to the room, she goes silent once more, lost in her own thoughts.

With a start, you wake. You open your bleary eyes and blink up at the ceiling, your mind still groggy. As the fogginess of sleep fades, you notice the room is darker than it should be. The emergency lighting is on. 

Unease knots your stomach and getting up quickly, you slip on your shoes. Standing there you look around trying to figure out what it was that awoke you, and then it hits you. It's silent, the train is not moving.

Without thinking, you reach out your hand to touch its surface. Your hand doesn't rest on the surface like you expected, rather it begins to pass through it. Shock and wonder fill your mind until something grabs you and pulls you through.

You've fallen to your knees and as the darkness recedes from your vision and you can see that you are in your room...and yet you are not. The desk and bed are on opposite sides, and what looks like tar covers the ceiling and bleeds down the walls. Behind you is the mirror and through it you see your real room, it's dim emergency lighting just barely illuminating your surroundings. Returning your attention to the inky black liquid, you see that it has now reached the floor and is oozing towards you. 
|BREAK|
As it gets closer, you back away step by step not taking your eyes off it. The light begins to fade and, glancing behind, you see that the liquid has begun to cover the mirror. In a split second, you make your decision and lunge through mirror, barely avoiding the reaching tendrils of darkness.
