The dining car is well lit with warm electric lighting that reflects off the polished wood tables and chairs. To one side is a couple of armchairs and a settee with a low table where one might chat or play a hand of cards. Further down lies the bar; closed at this late hour.

With a start, you wake. You open your bleary eyes and blink up at the ceiling, your mind still groggy. As the fogginess of sleep fades, you notice the room is darker than it should be. The emergency lighting is on. 

Unease knots your stomach and getting up quickly, you slip on your shoes. Standing there you look around trying to figure out what it was that awoke you, and then it hits you. It's silent, the train is not moving.

It takes a moment but then you realize the mirror shows everything but your own reflection.

Without thinking, you reach out your hand to touch its surface. Your hand doesn't rest on the surface like you expected, rather it begins to pass through it. Shock and wonder fill your mind until something grabs you and pulls you through.

You've fallen to your knees and as the darkness recedes from your vision and you can see that you are in your room...and yet you are not. The desk and bed are on opposite sides, and what looks like tar covers the ceiling and bleeds down the walls. Behind you is the mirror and through it you see your real room, it's dim emergency lighting just barely illuminating your surroundings. Returning your attention to the inky black liquid, you see that it has now reached the floor and is oozing towards you. 
|BREAK|
As it gets closer, you back away step by step not taking your eyes off it. The light begins to fade and, glancing behind, you see that the liquid has begun to cover the mirror. In a split second, you make your decision and lunge through mirror, barely avoiding the reaching tendrils of darkness.
