ROOM [init]: {Would you like another glass of water?” You blink out of your thoughts and look over to the waiter standing next to the table. He looks at you expectantly, waiting for a reply. (#Yes#, #No#) ^++init^} 

YES &init&: {You nod your head and give him a weak smile. He reaches over and, plucking your glass from the table, says “You’re still looking a little green around the gills, it’s quite common for those who haven’t ridden on a subrail before. It might help to lay down for a bit while your body adjusts to the depth.” He sets down your now full glass in front of you and with a smile departs, exiting through the West door labeled "Staff Only". |BREAK|Leaning back in your chair, you let your eyes wander across your surroundings. On the well worn table in front of you sits your glass, and on the wall beside you is a small #poster#. A few tables away sits an old #man# engrossed in his writing, and at the other end of the car is a young #woman# whose oly companion is an untouched cup of tea. There is a door to the #East# side of the car that leads to the passenger sleeping quarters. } 

NO &init&: {You shake your head and he smiles politely at you saying, “Let me know if you change your mind. You’re still looking a little green around the gills, it’s quite common for those who haven’t ridden on a subrail before. It might help to lay down for a bit while your body adjusts to the depth.” With a nod he departs, continuing his rounds to the few other tables that are occupied at this late hour.|BREAK|Leaning back in your chair, you let your eyes wander across your surroundings.

EXAMINE &init& [room]: {The dining car is well lit with warm electric lighting which reflects of the polished wood tables and chairs. To one side is a couple of armchairs and a settee with a low table where one might chat or play a hand of cards. Further down lies the bar, closed at this late hour. The rest of the room is filled with dining tables, only two of which are occupied; one by an older #man# and another by a young #woman#. To the #East# is a door leading to the passenger sleeping quarters. }

EXAMINE &init& [poster]: {The poster announces in large black letters, “Welcome Aboard the Transatlantic Subwater Rail! The safest way to cross the depths of the ocean!”}

EXAMINE &init& [man]: {The older man sits hunched over his table, engrossed in his writing. Looking closer, you can see that his once respectable suits now shows signs of considerable wear with patches haphazadly sewn on and stains decorating the surface. As he writes, he mutters under his breath and, although he pauses to drink his coffee, his eyes never stray from the pages in front of him.}
TALK &init& [man]: {Appraoching the man, you begin to speak but he stops you waving his hands and saying, “No, no, no, I can’t be bothered right now, I’ve almost solved it.”}

EXAMINE &init& [woman]: {The young woman sits alone at a table, an untouched cup of tea next to her. She’s wearing a pale blue dress of fine quality and you can see that she has soft hands, the kind that have never seen a hard day of labour. She stares vacantly at the room, her mind seemingly far away.}
TALK &init& [woman]: {You approach the young woman and greet her. She turns to you but her expression remains distant. 

“Can you feel it? Something is coming, something...dark.”

Shifting her gaze back to the room, she goes silent once more, lost in her own thoughts. }

GO &init& [east]: {You leave the dining car heading East into the hallway of the sleeper car and then into your own room. [[ROOM(your_room)]] }

GO &init& [west]: {You cannot go into the kitchen, only the staff are permitted there. }

ROOM [your_room_good]: {Your room is furnished in a practical fashion. Pushed against the wall is your #bed#, across from it is a small desk upon which sits your journal, and on the wall hangs a tall #mirror#. ^++your_room^ }

EXAMINE &your_room_good& [bed]: {The bed is neatly made with all the sheets and blanket tucked in at each corner. Although simple, it has a comfortable quality that can’t be found in a new one. }

USE &your_room_good& [bed]: {You take the waiter’s advice and decide to lay down for a bit now that your stomach is feeling more settled. Taking your shoes off, you lay down on your bed, planning to only close your eyes for a minute. Soon though, you feel the pull of sleep and drift off.|BREAK|*sleep_sequence.wav* [[your_room_bad]] }

EXAMINE &your_room_good& [mirror]: {The mirror is simply adorned, but it’s height and level surface allow you to examine your outfit from head to toe when you desire.}

USE &your_room& [mirror]: {Looking in the mirror, your reflection stares back at you with tired eyes. Your journey thus far has been fraught with frequent bouts of nausea as the trains travels along the ocean floor, and the toll is beginning to show. }
